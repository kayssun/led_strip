# led_strip

This gem is used (by me) to control my two led strip in my apartment. It is connected to two motion detectors and
lights up my hall from the direction I enter. This gem is probably quite useless without a description of the
hardware I am using. This will follow here once it works sufficiently.

If you are interested, drop me a note.

At the moment, you would need:
- A raspberry pi or another computer with an SPI interface
- One or two WS2801 led strips
- One or two motion detectors, something like a HC-SR501
- A power supply (obviously)
