# led_strip

This gem is used (by me) to control my two led strip in my apartment. It is connected to two motion detectors and
lights up my hall from the direction I enter. The current version is working though I am now completely
rewriting it be be more modular and make gem. When it is finished, I will document my hardware and describe the usage
of this gem in more detail here.
